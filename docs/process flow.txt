1. Each Process Should Contains 3 process lines, 1st's line type should be "Start", Last's is "End", and Pre's of Last is "Decision". So, the simplest process is Start-->Decision-->End.
2. Additional, Process May contain 1 or more lines with line type "Activity" between "Start" line and "Decision" line.
3. Each Process Line may contain 1 or more actions,these actions are parallel to each other,  it will go to next process line while all of those required actions have been processed, depend on action value (pass_next if approval,fail_next if decline). 
4. action value "decline" for actions in process lines will cause different result for documents, "Decline" with line type "Decision" but "ReEdit" with line type "Start" or "Activity".
5. "decline" for only actions in process line will cause process line fail, in other words, success only when all action value of actions are "Approval".
6. add "sys_pd_process_v.xml" to any root layout those need to process process_flow.
